subtitle: >-
  Unless you tend to your processes daily they will degrade over time. The
  Toyota Production System uses the concept of a Kata. A action repeated
  frequently, so as to make it a reflex.

excerpt: >-
  The Toyota Production System uses the word Kata to mean a practice that, when
  repeated regularly, becomes a reflex. The Processes you have established need
  to be tended to frequently, even daily, to observe how they are performing.
  Check in with your processes daily, to tweak, prune, and weed. It is through
  this constant gardening of your processes that the seeds and sprouts you plant
  will grown and flourish.
