  Processes need frequent attention to maximize their performance. Check in with
  your processes daily, to tweak, prune, and weed. By diligent gardening your
  processes, the seeds and sprouts will grown and flourish.

Unless you tend to your processes daily they will degrade over time. The Toyota Production System uses the concept of a Kata, an action repeated, to make it a reflex.

> Toyota takes the view that if a process is not improving, then it is degrading; Toyota managers will always restandardize a process after every improvement, but they will not be content to rest there, since they know the new condition will deteriorate unless daily improvements are made.

Like a garden which will grow if not tended to, any process you put in place unless improved will degrade.
Setting the next maturity goal, and workIng to achieve it everyday. This is the gardening that ensures the processes stays in a mature state.
Do each of your processes have a defined maturity goal?
