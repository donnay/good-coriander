## First establish what good looks like

For any process that can be measured, it is essential to establish what is the desired future state. By agreeing upon, and establishing a goal, the measurement of the status quo against that goal is enabled.

Maturity for any given process is a continuum from immature to mature. One model of process maturity that can be applied to many instances is that of [Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration) is a process and behavioural model that helps organizations streamline process improvement and encourage productive, efficient behaviours that decrease risks in software, product, and service development.

The stages are as follows: <br>

1. Initial - This is the un-improved state. The process is chaotic, un-ordered, inconsistent.<br>
2. Managed - This is the stage after initial intervention. Awareness of As Is and To Be state.<br>
3. Defined - The process has been defined. Compliance is inconsistent. <br>
4. Quantitatively Managed - Measurements are available. Goals are defined and regular management occurs with the goal of improvement.<br>
5. Optimized - Managing the performance of the process is embedded, and self-motivated. <br>
